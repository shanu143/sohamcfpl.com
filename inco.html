<strong><div style="margin:0px 200px;color:Black;">  ♦ Contract of Carriage </div></strong><br />

<p><div style="margin:0px 150px;color:Black;">The Incoterm utilized in a transaction will dictate which party is responsible for each transportation segment and it's corresponding contract of carriage. The Incoterm that is utilized can affect the title passage in foreign trade.<br /><br />

<a name="3"></a>
<strong><div style="margin:0px 200px;color:Black;">  ♦ Contract of Carriage </div></strong><br />

<p><div style="margin:0px 150px;color:Black;">Pre-Carriage:  the transportation segment from the seller's location to the point where the cargo would leave from the seller's side.  Example, to arrange for pre-carriage, you would contract with an inland carrier to make delivery to a port or airport. <br /><br />

Main-Carriage: the transportation segment from the seller's side to the buyer's side. Example, to arrange for main-carriage, you would contract for ocean or air carriage.<br /><br />

On-Carriage: the transportation segment from the point of arrival (on the buyer's side), to the designated ultimate receiver.  Example, to arrange for on-carriage, you would contract with an inland carrier to make delivery from the port/airport of arrival to the ultimate receiver.</div><br /></p><br />
